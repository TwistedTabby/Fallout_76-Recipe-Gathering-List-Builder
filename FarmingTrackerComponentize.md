# FarmingTracker Componentization Plan

## Current Structure Analysis

The current `FarmingTracker.tsx` file is very large and contains:
- Multiple interfaces and type definitions
- Database initialization and management
- Utility functions
- A main component with numerous state variables
- Many handler functions for different operations
- Complex UI rendering logic

## Componentization Goals

1. **Improve maintainability** by breaking down the monolithic component
2. **Enhance readability** through logical separation of concerns
3. **Facilitate testing** with smaller, focused components
4. **Enable reusability** of common UI patterns and functionality

## Proposed Component Structure

### 1. Types and Interfaces

Move all interfaces and types to a separate file:

```typescript
// src/types/farmingTracker.ts
export interface Item {...}
export interface Stop {...}
export interface Route {...}
export interface RouteProgress {...}
// Include all other interfaces
```

### 2. Database Layer

Create a custom hook for database operations:

```typescript
// src/hooks/useFarmingTrackerDB.ts
export function useFarmingTrackerDB() {
  // DB initialization logic
  // CRUD operations for routes, tracking, etc.
  return {
    initDB,
    loadRoutes,
    saveRoute,
    deleteRoute,
    // Other DB operations
  };
}
```

### 3. Component Hierarchy

#### Core Components

1. **FarmingTrackerApp** (Main container)
   - Manages global state
   - Handles routing between different views

2. **RouteList**
   - Displays list of available routes
   - Handles route selection

3. **RouteEditor**
   - Manages route creation and editing
   - Contains StopList component

4. **StopEditor**
   - Manages individual stop editing
   - Contains ItemList component

5. **ItemEditor**
   - Handles item creation and editing

6. **RouteTracker**
   - Manages active route tracking
   - Shows current progress
   - Handles item collection

7. **InventoryTracker**
   - Manages inventory data collection
   - Shows inventory changes

#### Utility Components

1. **ConfirmDialog**
   - Reusable confirmation dialog

2. **Notification**
   - Toast notifications system

3. **DragDropList**
   - Reusable component for drag-and-drop reordering

4. **ImportExportTools**
   - Handles data import/export functionality

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Extract Types and Interfaces

1. Move interfaces and types to `src/types/farmingTracker.ts`
2. Extract utility functions to `src/utils/farmingTrackerUtils.ts`
3. Create database hook in `src/hooks/useFarmingTrackerDB.ts`

#### Implementation Notes - Phase 1
