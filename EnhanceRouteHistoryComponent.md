1. Utilize the existing getRouteById function:
 - The component interface already includes getRouteById?: (routeId: string) => Promise<any>, which seems designed for this purpose.
 - We'll need to ensure this prop is properly passed down from the parent component.
2. Fetch and store route data:
 - Add a state variable to store route information for each history entry.
 - When a history entry is expanded or when the component mounts, fetch the associated route data using the getRouteById function.
3. Display route context in the UI:
- Enhance the history entry display to show relevant route information like route name, description, or other identifying details.
- This will provide users with context about what each history entry represents.
4. Optimize data fetching:
- Implement caching to avoid redundant route data fetching.
- Consider batch loading route data for visible history entries.
5. Update UI components:
- Add new UI elements to display the route information.
- Ensure the design is consistent with the existing UI.
- Use appropriate color schemes and components from your design system.
6. Handle edge cases:
- Add error handling for cases where route data cannot be retrieved.
- Provide fallback UI for missing route information.
- Consider what happens if a history entry references a route that no longer exists.
7. Update tests:
- Modify existing tests to account for the new functionality.
- Add new tests to verify the route information display.
